        <p>Throughout my career, I have had the honour of working with different regulators who shoulder great responsibility for ensuring compliance with privacy and access laws in a rapidly evolving digital world. I have also worked with public institutions who must implement requirements in the real world, as well as astute practitioners who have a very practical sense of the opportunities and challenges at play, academics who have devoted their careers to advancing knowledge in this critical field, and dedicated civil society groups who play such a vital role in advancing access and privacy rights for the benefit of us all. </p>

        <p>This broad experience has taught me to listen to, and appreciate, the many diverse perspectives that come to bear on the complex issues we deal with. It has instilled a sense of humility with which I approach my work and a natural inclination to consult and collaborate with others to reach pragmatic solutions with beneficial impacts.</p>

        <p>This is why, when I began my mandate as Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, I came with a vision of a modern and effective regulator dedicated to supporting compliance and promoting public trust in our public institutions.</p>

        <p>To achieve this vision, my office aims to be consultative and constructive in our engagement with institutions. Two thousand twenty-two presented many such opportunities. We reached out to organizations in the sectors we regulate to let them know how they can tap into the IPC’s access and privacy expertise as they develop new programs and initiatives by requesting a <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/about-us/policy-consultations/" target="_blank">policy consultation</a> with my office. When organizations proactively engage with us, we can better understand their realities, provide comment on the adoption and deployment of new technologies, and help address potential concerns upstream before they become real problems downstream.</p>

        <p>Being a modern and effective regulator also means being well-measured and balanced in our interventions and taking a risk-based approach to our oversight role. Our role is not just to make orders and wield fines and penalties when problems occur but to help organizations learn from their mistakes and prevent them from recurring. This practical and proportionate approach to our regulatory role was exemplified in our <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/newsrelease/information-and-privacy-commissioner-of-ontario-reveals-insights-from-examination-of-fax-privacy-breaches-at-st-josephs-healthcare-hamilton/" target="_blank">review</a> of a regional hospital’s high number of privacy breaches due to misdirected faxes, <a href="#">our collaborative efforts with a government ministry to address their unique</a> freedom of information challenges and <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/newsrelease/ontario-ipc-concludes-its-review-of-durham-regions-privacy-breach/" target="_blank">our response</a> to a serious cyberattack at a regional municipality.</p>

        <p>To realize our vision of a modern and effective regulator, the IPC is committed to working toward real-world outcomes that benefit Ontarians. Our four <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/about-us/ipc-strategic-priorities-2021-2025-final-report/" target="_blank">strategic priorities</a> guide our proactive work and help keep us focused on the most relevant issues to Ontarians and in areas where we can have the greatest positive impact. Providing thought leadership and having influence in these novel and emerging areas requires bringing many great minds together and hearing from a plurality of external voices. </p>

        <p>To help us do this, the IPC convened a permanent <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/about-us/ipc-strategic-advisory-council-2021-25/" target="_blank">Strategic Advisory Council</a>, composed of twenty-five privacy and access experts across all sectors we regulate. To ensure the voices of young people are also at the table, we recruited a new <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/about-us/ipcs-youth-advisory-council/" target="_blank">Youth Advisory Council</a> to address the unique needs of Ontario’s children and youth. In September 2022, we welcomed the IPC’s <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/ipc-welcomes-professor-teresa-scassa-as-its-first-scholar-in-residence/" target="_blank">first Scholar-in-Residence</a>, Professor <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/about-us/scholar-in-residence/" target="_blank">Teresa Scassa</a>, Canada Research Chair in Information Law and Policy, at the University of Ottawa. This new program provides a unique opportunity for thought leaders like Professor Scassa to apply their extensive academic knowledge and expertise to concrete policy development in key priority areas.</p>

        <p>To be a modern and effective regulator, we must also strive to meet the highest standards Ontarians expect of us. With that objective in mind, we have worked extensively over the past year to provide digitally-friendly services to Ontarians while improving their user experience when interacting with our office. We have undertaken a review of our tribunal processes and procedures and developed a concrete plan to enhance our capacity to provide timely resolution to appeals and complaints, render plain-language decisions, and develop practical and actionable guidance by drawing on lessons learned from individual cases for the benefit of others.</p>

        <p>Finally, in our journey to becoming  a modern and effective regulator, we have introduced innovations into our own workplace. We’re modernizing how we work and using online collaborative tools to enhance employee engagement as part of our new reality of hybrid work. We have ensured best practices in fiscal management, comptrollership, and internal governance to strengthen our accountability to the people we serve.</p>

        <p>As we reflect on the past year, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my staff. Their in-depth knowledge, hard work and dedication have been instrumental in achieving our goals and advancing our mission.</p>

        <p>Our work in 2022 resulted in noteworthy advancements for access and privacy rights in Ontario. This report provides an overview of our activities and accomplishments over the past year, demonstrating our commitment to protect and promote the privacy and access rights of Ontarians.</p>

                    <p>On International Right to Know Day 2022, the IPC launched a <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/access-organizations/open-government/join-the-ipcs-transparency-challenge/" target="_blank">Transparency Challenge</a>, calling on public institutions subject to the <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90f31_e.htm"><i>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)</a> and the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (MFIPPA)</i> to share their innovative programs that improve government transparency for the benefit of Ontarians. </p>

                    <p>We invited creative examples of programs that modernize and improve government transparency, promote civic engagement, and show how proactive disclosure and open data initiatives can have tangible and positive impacts. The Transparency Challenge provided a way to increase awareness and understanding of the benefits of proactive disclosure and open data in improving the day-to-day lives of Ontarians.</p>

                    <p>Institutions rose to the challenge and submitted many exciting and innovative projects. These submissions, from provincial ministries and agencies, municipalities, universities, and police services, were featured in a digital <a href="https://transparencyshowcase.ipc.on.ca/en/" target="_blank">Transparency Showcase</a>, unveiled in spring 2023. The showcase illustrates compelling examples to help encourage and inspire other public institutions toward greater openness and transparency.</p>

                    <span class="sub-heading">FPT digital ID resolution</span>
                    <p>Proposals for digital identity or other forms of digital credentials are emerging in Canada and around the world to make it easier for individuals, businesses, and governments to confirm identity information and conduct online transactions more seamlessly and efficiently.</p>
                    <p>In October, the IPC joined its federal, provincial, and territorial counterparts to call on governments and relevant partners to ensure that privacy and transparency rights are respected throughout the design, operation, and evolution of digital identity ecosystems in Canada. Privacy and transparency must be at the core of any digital ID system people will trust and adopt. The joint resolution set out the conditions necessary for nurturing that trust. Among these conditions:</p>
                    <p style="background-color: rgb(195 232 108 / 40%); padding: 4px 10px;">Digital ID systems should be optional and equitably accessible to all. They should only collect, use, or share the minimum amount of personal information needed to confirm identity and must not be used to create any central databases. They shouldn’t force people to identify themselves when it isn’t necessary to access a product or service and must not allow tracking or tracing of credential use for other purposes.</p>
                    <p style="background-color: rgb(195 232 108 / 40%); padding: 4px 10px;">These systems must be secured from identity theft, fraud or other harms, and, most importantly, governments and organizations must be held accountable for their use and subject to independent oversight.</p>

                    <span class="sub-heading">Trustworthy AI Frameworks</span>
                    <p>Rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI) offer tremendous opportunities to address many of society’s most complex problems across all sectors of society. AI technologies can be used to fast-track the delivery of government services, solve major public health issues, and reconfigure our cities. They can improve public safety, respond to global emergencies, enhance commercial innovation, and bolster our economy.</p>
                    <p>Yet, without appropriate guardrails, AI technologies risk crossing the lines beyond what Ontarians consider legally, socially, and ethically acceptable. Irresponsible uses of AI can trample privacy and other fundamental human rights by attempting to predict human behaviour and making consequential decisions based on potentially flawed predictions. AItechnologies have begun generating new “machine-made” knowledge, images and voices that call into question the integrity and accuracy of information as we know it. They can persuade and nudgee our behaviour in ways that can potentially jeopardize our fundamental sense of human agency. In July, Commissioner Kosseim wrote a blog, Privacy and humanity on the brink, outlining the risks inherent in too-rapidly adopting information technologies, especially when combined with biotechnologies, and the significant impacts these can have on our future generations.</p>
                    <p>In her blog, the commissioner urged the government to intensify its consultation efforts, particularly among marginalized groups and communities that are most impacted by algorithmic decision-making. She also called for increased investments into developing the capacity required to carry out privacy and human rights impact assessments. This includes practical educational guidance to support institutions and organizations in carrying out these assessments, funding for interdisciplinary research into thethe ethical, legal, and social impacts of AI, and foresight methodologies to anticipate and address future scenarios.</p>
                    <p>In 2021, the government considered an approach to govern public sector use of AI systems in a discussion paper Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Framework to which our office responded. <span style="background-color: rgb(195 232 108 / 40%); color: #242D38; padding: 4px 10px;">We urge the government to pursue its consultations on a trustworthy framework for AI and resume its leadership stance in this critically important area. A comprehensive legal or policy framework is urgently needed to govern public and private sector use of artificial intelligence within clear and transparent boundaries that align with Ontarians’ rights and values, and, fundamentally, in a way that Ontarians can trust.</span></p>

                    <p>In September 2022, the IPC issued a call to Ontario youth, inviting them to join the IPC’s new Youth Advisory Council.</p>
                    <p>Our goal was to bring together a group of young people from different communities across the province, with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and outlooks, to share their views about digital literacy, access, and privacy rights in Ontario.</p>
                    <p>This group of highly-engaged youth will help the IPC develop education and outreach materials that are even more relevant to young people. Their work over the coming years will help us guide the next generation through the opportunities and risks of the online world. By broadening the conversation and engaging young people with a seat at the table, we can learn from them and enhance our efforts to make the digital world a better place for future generations.</p>

                    <p>After careful deliberation, in 2022, the IPC launched an Instagram account to connect with Ontario’s children and youth. Our objective is to teach them about privacy risks and how to protect themselves online. Our account, @IPC.Ontario, is a trusted online space where young people can get useful and age-appropriate tips on how to protect their privacy online and access their records from a government institution, health care provider or children’s aid society.</p>
                    <p>The account features eye-catching, bite-sized content. For example, Halloween-themed posts warned about some of the “privacy monsters” lurking in the digital world and Santa’s little helpers offered kids helpful tips on privacy settings for their new electronic games and toys. Colourful characters, infographics, and whiteboard videos make learning fun and easy.</p>

                    <p>Throughout 2022, the IPC worked with MediaSmarts, Canada’s Centre for Digital Literacy, to develop lesson plans for teachers, parents and caregivers building on the critical messages contained in Privacy Pursuit! Games and Activities for Kids. The carefully designed lesson plans, aimed at grades two through eight, will be released in time for the 2023-24 academic year. They are intended to provide Ontario’s educators with practical methods for teaching young people about important concepts related to digital safety. These include how to use, strengthen, and protect passwords, limit what information they share online, avoid online scams, and protect themselves against cyber threats. They also contain critical lessons to help kids develop privacy empathy and learn how to respect the privacy of others.</p>

                    <p>Statistics collected by our office in 2022 revealed a continuing concern with misdirected faxes in the health sector, representing almost 38 per cent of health privacy breaches in Ontario.</p>
                    <p>Using outdated and vulnerable technologies such as faxes and unencrypted email threatens to erode public confidence that personal health information is secure. In September, the IPC joined its federal, provincial, and territorial counterparts in issuing a joint resolution addressing insecure methods of transmitting personal health information. The resolution calls on governments and relevant partners in the health sector to replace traditional faxes and unencrypted email with more secure forms of digital communication. The resolution is an urgent call to action given what we know to be the largest source of health data breaches reported to our office over several years. </p>
                    <p style="background-color: rgb(195 232 108 / 40%); padding: 4px 10px;">In the resolution, the IPC and our counterparts urge governments to address the issue by coordinating a strategic plan and providing institutions with appropriate supports, such as funding or other incentives, to phase out traditional fax and unencrypted email. The resolution asks governments to promote the adoption of more modern and secure digital alternatives that are equitably available and accessible to all, and calls on health sector organizations and providers to do their part as well. Finally, the resolution commits the IPC and our counterparts to collaborate with interested parties to support this transition and to provide relevant privacy and security guidance and public education about the risks and opportunities associated with digital communications and virtual health care.</p>
                    <p style="background-color: rgb(195 232 108 / 40%); padding: 4px 10px;">In February 2023, the government announced a plan to phase out faxes in the health sector over a five-year timeline. Our office applauds this initiative and stands ready to assist the government and other interested parties in implementing this plan in a manner that supports public trust. We look forward to seeing the health care sector continue to decrease its dependency on faxes in favour of more secure forms of digital communication.</p>

                    <p>The IPC strongly urges the government to ensure that any new data governance framework or changes to PHIPA intended to increase the sharing of personal health information be counterbalanced by robust accountability and transparency measures to protect Ontarians’ privacy and support public trust.</p>
                    <p>To start, the IPC strongly encourages the government to fully implement the PHIPA reforms adopted back in 2019 and 2020 dealing with electronic audit logs, consumer electronic service providers, deidentification standards and administrative penalties by proclaiming those sections of PHIPA into force and adopting the necessary regulations to enable them to finally come into effect.</p>

                    <p>In our 2021 annual report, the commissioner recommended the government set out the details of PHIPA’s administrative penalty scheme in regulations The purpose of these administrative penalties is to encourage compliance and prevent persons from deriving, directly or indirectly, any economic benefit as a result of contravening Ontario’s health privacy law or its regulations This would enable the IPC to impose monetary consequences on the few bad actors who unfortunately undermine Ontarians’ trust in the entire health system. </p>
                    <p>We expect the government to release the proposed regulation for public comment, setting out the criteria to be considered by the IPC when imposing a penalty and the maximum dollar amounts We look forward to seeing this regulation come into force and giving Ontarians confidence that there are effective mechanisms in place to promote positive behaviour, while stamping out the bad.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with our vision of a modern and effective regulator, the IPC will apply a proportionate approach to administrative penalties We intend to adopt the principles and philosophy of a just culture approach by applying different levels of intervention based on the nature and circumstances of the contravention The choice of enforcement tool (whether it be education, corrective measures, recommendations, orders, administrative penalties or referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of an offence) will depend on a range of factors, including the conduct of the person or organization in question Such conduct could range from a single honest mistake to a repetitive pattern based on carelessness; from a minor error in judgment to a more serious one; from recklessness or disregard for the rules to deliberate intent to break the rules for malicious or profit-seeking motives Where appropriate, we will also look at the organization’s governance structures and processes in place to determine to what extent, if any, these (or the lack thereof) may have contributed to the conditions that enabled the contravention to take place</p>

                    <p>In August 2022, the Office of the Chief Coroner provided the IPC with the jury recommendations of an inquest into the murders of three women in rural eastern Ontario. Recommendation 78 called on the IPC to work with the Domestic Violence Death Review Committee, justice partners, and intimate partner violence service providers to develop a plain language tool to empower intimate partner violence professionals to make informed decisions about privacy, confidentiality, and public safety. Our office readily agreed to carry out this critically-important recommendation.</p>
                    <p>Protecting personal information from unauthorized collection, use, and disclosure is essential. However, privacy must not be used as an excuse to prevent the lawful sharing of information, particularly when it is necessary to prevent serious harm. To implement recommendation 78, the IPC began consultations with intimate partner violence professionals to identify the dominant privacy issues and help balance the values, objectives and interests at play. We will report on outcomes in our next annual report.</p>

                <span class="sub-heading">One day mediation pilot project</span>
                <p>To streamline processes, the mediation team launched a pilot project in 2022 where parties in select sole-issue appeals were invited to participate in a half-day teleconference. The goal was to resolve the appeal during or shortly after the teleconference.</p>
                <p>Almost all of the institutions contacted had great interest in participating as they recognized the benefits of avoiding a lengthy back and forth through protracted discussions and correspondence between the parties, with a view to enhancing the likelihood of a quick resolution when all parties work together in real-time.</p>
                <p>This project was a resounding success, with 90 per cent of files resolved before, on the day of, or shortly after the teleconference. On average, these files took 75 per cent less time to process relative to files that proceeded through the regular mediation stream. Both appellants and institutions enthusiastically endorsed this shortened process for appropriate files. The team looks forward to expanding on the success of this project in the year ahead.</p>

                <p>In August 2022, and as part of our efforts to modernize and provide digital services to  Ontarians, the IPC launched a new service for filing and paying for appeals online, making it easier for people to file an appeal with our office — online, anytime. Since the launch of this new online service, we have seen a rapid uptake in the number of appellants who have taken advantage of this convenient means to submit and pay for their FIPPA and MFIPPA appeals. From August to December 2022, the IPC received 275 appeals (51 per cent) electronically compared to 264 (49 per cent) through other methods.</p>

                <p>Throughout 2022, the IPC undertook a thorough review of its FIPPA and MFIPPA Code of Procedure and associated practice directions. These key documents that guide the appeals process had not undergone a significant review and revision since 2004.</p>
                <p>Since then, the tribunal has embraced the use of electronic methods of communication and records submission which require revisions to the code of procedure. The code of procedure also needs to better reflect the current state of the tribunal’s operations and procedures, which have evolved to become more streamlined and efficient while still respecting rules of procedural fairness. We expect to implement a new code of procedure in 2023, following a reasonable advance public notice period.</p>

                <p>Three school boards, one college, and two universities contacted the IPC to report a ransomware attack on guard.me. Guard.me, a third-party company providing insurance coverage to international students at these institutions, experienced a ransomware attack that affected the personal information of some of their students.</p>
                <p>At the time, a significant number of the institutions’ international students were required or encouraged to provide personal information to guard.me to receive mandatory insurance coverage. In most cases, the student provided their claims information directly to guard.me and the institution only provided limited enrollment information. During its review, the IPC found that some of the institutions did not have a contractual agreement with guard.me to ensure the confidentiality and security of the personal information disclosed to the company. In addition, some of the institutions did not get the students’ consent or provide clear notice to them before providing their personal information to guard.me. Following our review, the institutions have implemented or committed to implementing changes we recommended to address these and other gaps.</p>

                <p>Over two months, a city received requests from a legal clinic for information relating to poverty, homelessness, encampments, overdose prevention, and race-based data. The city denied five of the requests outright on the basis that they appeared to be frivolous or vexatious. The parties agreed to participate in the expedited mediation pilot project and succeeded in quickly resolving the issues. During the teleconference, the appellant better explained the type of information they were seeking, and the city provided guidance on how to reformulate the request using certain keywords and timeframes. As a result of the mediation discussions, four appeals were resolved on the same day, and the fifth was resolved shortly after.</p>

                <span class="optional-text">Selling de-identified health data \\ PHIPA 175</span>
                <p>After learning that a health information custodian was allegedly selling de-identified personal health information to a third party, the IPC opened an investigation. We found that de-identifying personal health information was a permitted use without consent under PHIPA, but subject to certain conditions, including transparency and safeguarding obligations. We found that custodians planning to de-identify and sell data must clearly and explicitly state this in their public notice to individuals. The custodian’s security obligations also required that they take reasonable steps to protect and secure personal health information, including during the de-identification process and afterwards. Notably, sale agreements with third parties must include adequate security and privacy controls to ensure de-identified data remains de-identified, including a robust de-identification governance process with regular re-identification risk assessments.</p>

                <p>Within a relatively short period, requesters made dozens of multi-part, excessively detailed, and significantly overlapping requests for records relating to a class-action lawsuit against a town. The requesters were acting on behalf of the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit. The town denied the requests on the basis that they were frivolous or vexatious, and the requesters appealed. The adjudicator found that the appellants’ pattern of conduct — the filing of an inordinate number of detailed and repetitive requests — was an abuse of the right of access found in MFIPPA, and that the requests were frivolous or vexatious. The adjudicator upheld the town’s decisions to deny the requests and placed limits on the appellants’ future access requests and appeals.</p>

                <p>In 2022, we addressed the findings of our 2021 threat risk assessments by implementing key IT upgrades and cyber security enhancements. We launched a new online appeal service, allowing Ontarians to securely file and pay for their appeals electronically. We implemented a corporate wireless network to enable greater in-office mobility and inter-departmental collaboration between IPC employees. We launched a pilot for a new Office 365 solution and prepared the necessary groundwork to securely move IPC’s information holdings to the cloud. In 2023, we will continue to enhance our digital services with a project to implement a new IPC website built on modern technologies, featuring greater potential for interactivity and an improved user experience.</p>

                <p>Throughout 2022, the IPC slowly and gradually returned staff to the office for certain in-person activities. We worked towards an eventual hybrid work model, which evolved over three phases, beginning with those activities that staff felt would be best carried out in person to promote greater employee collaboration, cohesion, and sense of community. Each phase built upon the previous one, incorporating staff feedback while ensuring support for the effective delivery of our mandate and offering flexibility for employees. The IPC will implement its permanent hybrid work arrangements in spring 2023, that will balance in-office business and operational requirements, while providing staff with flexible work-from-home arrangements and quality work-life balance.</p>
                <p>As part of our employee engagement efforts, the IPC launched both a formal and informal employee recognition program to celebrate significant milestone achievements and to express particular appreciation for employees and teams who best exemplify IPC values.</p>
                <p>In 2022, the IPC also established a new IPC Champion program, comprising individuals and teams among our ranks who volunteered to actively promote bilingualism; community giving; health and wellness; inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility. In addition, the IPC re-established and reconfigured its Joint Health and Safety Committee, Social Committee, Equity and Accessibility Committee, Green Committee, and Learning Committee. These staff-led initiatives provide new leadership and learning opportunities, help spark creative and innovative ideas, promote a shared spirit of collaboration, and foster a sense of purpose and camaraderie that bring out the best of IPC.</p>
                <p>We also developed a virtual suggestion box to allow employees a safe space to provide anonymous, unsolicited feedback to senior management. Ongoing and constructive input from our staff on how we can continually improve as an organization will help build the IPC’s potential and reputation as an employer of choice.</p>
